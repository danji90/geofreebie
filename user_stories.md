# User Stories

Included after each story is a potential implementation.

1. As a user I want to find nearby offers so that I can pick one up.

    - Look at the list view, with offers sorted by distance (show distance in list)
    - Click on desired offer
    - See information about the offer and the user who is offering it
    - Click on a link to contact the user

2. As a user, I want to update info about what I am offering so that I can give something away.

    - Click button on the Dashboard
    - Enter offer information in the form provided

3. As a user, I want to be notified when I am near to something being given away, so that I can find things I want without looking for them.

    - Turn on notifications in the settings panel
    - See notification when a offer is nearby (definition of nearby TBD)
    - Click on the notification to be taken to the map view of the offer
    - Click on a link to contact the user

4. As a user, I want to be able to choose how close I should be to an object to be notified, so that I'm not bothered constantly when I'm too far away.

    - In the settings panel, next to the notifications on/off switch, enter the notification distance into the text box provided for that purpose

5. As a user, I want to have control over my location data, so that I can have privacy.

    a. As a user, I want to choose when the app can know my location.

    b. As a user, I want to choose when other users can know how close I am.

    c. As a user, I want to choose when other users can know my location.

6. As a user, I want to let other users know when I am available to give them my offer, so that it is possible to meet up spontaneously.

7. As a user, I want to be presented with my options when I log in, so that I can get oriented and take action right away.

8. As a user, I want to be reminded of my status when I log in, so that I know how others are seeing me.

9. As a user, I want to be updated on the community's status when I log in, so that I feel like a part of something bigger.

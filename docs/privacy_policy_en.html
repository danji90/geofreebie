      <p>Hi, I'm Lucas!</p>

      <p> I built the Geofreebie app as an open source app as part of my master thesis at the University of MÃ¼nster.</p>

      <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

      <p>For the purpose of the study for which I made this app, I collect and store the personal data that you provide, such as your name, age, contact information, and location data.</p>

      <p>This data will be stored on a cloud server during the study. When the study is over, I will anonymize your data and combine it with the data from all of the app's other users.</p>

      <p>In this form, it might be published in academic journals, presentations or other media, but never in a way that would allow people to identify you. I will not use your data for anything else.</p>

      <p><strong>You control your data</strong></p>

      <p>You are free to stop, quit the study and ask me to delete your data at any time during the study with no further consequences. I will do so as soon as I possibily can without any questions.</p>

      <p><strong>Contact</strong></p>

      <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions about this privacy policy, do not hesitate to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
